# C++ Tinkerings

I am learning C++ and am using this repository to collect various ideas that I come up with.

## Getting Started

The repository is divided into two parts.
1. Code in CPPTinkerings/ folder which builds into the include/ and lib/ folders.
2. Code in examples/ folder which provides usage examples for the code built as libraries in previous step.

## Installing

After the directory is cloned, you execute the following commands.

```sh
sh build.sh all
```

This will build the code in CPPTinkerings/ into include and lib folders. This will also build code in examples/ into examples/bin.

For more options to build.sh execute the following command.
```sh
sh build.sh -h
```
